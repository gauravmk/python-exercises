# Python Exercises

In this repo you'll find two sets of exercises:

### List Comprehension

These are intended to help practice list comprehension in python.
The goal is to write a one liner for each one of them. To test your
solutions, run `python list_comprehension.py`

### Recursion

These are intended to help practice recursion. Each one of these problems
can be broken down into smaller versions of the same problem. Figure out
how and the recursive solution should pop out. To test your solutions,
run `python recursion.py`
